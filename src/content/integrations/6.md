# How to Integrate Yandex with Your App

Yandex.Checkout offers a flexible and secure way to process payments, making it an ideal choice for businesses targeting Russian consumers. Follow these steps to integrate Yandex.Checkout into your application:

## Step 1: Register with YooMoney

First, visit [YooMoney for Business](https://yoomoney.ru/) and sign up for a merchant account. You will need to provide your business details and go through a verification process to activate your account.

## Step 2: Explore YooMoney API Documentation

After registration, familiarize yourself with the [YooMoney API documentation](https://yookassa.ru/developers/api). YooMoney provides comprehensive guides and API references to help you understand how to integrate their payment services into your app.

## Step 3: Obtain API Credentials

Once your account is set up, you'll receive API credentials, including a shopId and a secret key. These credentials are essential for authenticating your application's requests to the YooMoney API.

## Step 4: Implement the API

With your API credentials in hand, implement the necessary API calls in your application. YooMoney offers SDKs for popular programming languages to streamline this process:

- Use the SDK to initiate payment processing.
- Implement webhooks to receive notifications about payment status changes.

## Step 5: Secure Your Transactions

Ensure that your application complies with PCI DSS standards to securely handle payment information. Additionally, implement HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between your app and YooMoney.

## Step 6: Test Your Integration

Utilize YooMoney's test environment to thoroughly test the payment process in your application. Make sure to test different payment methods and scenarios to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Step 7: Go Live

After successful testing, complete any remaining verification steps required by YooMoney. Then, switch your integration from the test environment to the live environment to start accepting real payments.

## Support

If you encounter any issues during the integration process or have further questions, contact YooMoney support at `integration@yoomoney.ru` or refer to the [YooMoney Help Center](https://yoomoney.ru/en/support) for additional resources and assistance.
