          “ I love how opinionated Flabbergasted is. It helps us move fast.
          There’s more “doing” and less figuring out how to do it.

        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <p>
          The tool has been designed to simplify my life and my team's life by
          aiding in understanding, decision making, issue triage, and follow-up.
          The built-in features of Flabbergasted have exceeded my expectations and
          provided a native experience that is nearly perfect. My evaluation of
          products is based on their ease of use in performing basic actions,
          such as changing or editing text, and in this regard, Flabbergasted is
          incredibly intuitive. Whether I need to edit text or move an issue,
          the platform works seamlessly, feeling like an extension of myself.
          The team's attention to detail and consideration for user experience
          is evident in the thought and effort put into developing Flabbergasted.
